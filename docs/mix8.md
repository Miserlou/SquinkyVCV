# 8 channel mixer

This module started with a very simple idea. Make a mixer based the popular AS 8-CH Mixer, and fix the problems with. The problems we saw being the very high CPU usage, and the absence of anti-pop on the mutes.

But we got carried away and added channel solo, CV for mutes, and an effect/aux bus.

Even with these new features, however, the CPU usage is still only 10% of the original.
